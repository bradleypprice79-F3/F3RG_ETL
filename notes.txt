Create and manage dimension tables
AOs - all AOs by ao_id
date_table - dates and weeks (week 0 through week 6)
PAXcurrent - PAX names by user_id 
    refresh this guy daily
PAXdraft - Teams that Pax are on.  
    keep a report of PAX that post but are not on a team.
    If someone posts, but is not on a team (a naperville guy who did not declare) then add him to the NONE team.
        Filter NONEs out from reports
    If someone is FNG worthy, flag as FNG
    I included a notes column un PAXdraft so we can comment about when they were added and why they were flagged the way they were.


Daily, bring in postdata.  
    refresh the entire etl each time.  no appending, just truncate and load.
        prior to truncate, save the current processed dataset, incase there are questions on why history changed.


ETL process
1) create processed post data.
    add pax name, team name, fng flag, daily points (3 for post, 3 for EC3, etc.)


daily team points
    Santa Locks (for teams daily, show count of pax at each AO, list of PAX, and then SantaLock point totals)
        date / week / team / AO / PAXlist / PAXcount / SLpoints

    daily point totals could then be summed for individuals or Teams.
