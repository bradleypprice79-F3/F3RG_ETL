    <h1>QSource Week 1 – The Foundation: Why QSource Matters</h1>

    <p class="lead"><strong>Opening and Framing the Conversation</strong></p>
    <p>
      Every HIM wants to make an impact. We want to lead well — in our families, our workplaces,
      and our communities. But leadership isn’t something that happens by accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      F3 gives us three opportunities to accelerate: <strong>Fitness</strong>, <strong>Fellowship</strong>,
      and <strong>Faith</strong>. QSource builds on that by helping us accelerate our <strong>Leadership</strong> —
      not just what we do, but who we are becoming as men of influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the next six weeks, we’ll explore what F3 calls <strong>G3L</strong> — Get Right, Live Right,
      Lead Right, and Leave Right. Each quadrant represents a stage of growth in the life of a HIM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we dive into those, though, we need to understand the foundation — why QSource exists, what it is,
      and how it helps us fight drift and isolation to become the leaders we’re meant to be.
    </p>

    <hr class="sep">

    <h2>The Problem: Why QSource Exists</h2>

    <blockquote>
      In his VQ COT, Scuba Steve shared something powerful. He said, “Life has a way of isolating us.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      And he’s right. We don’t mean to get isolated — it just happens. Work gets busy. Family responsibilities
      pile up. Friendships fade if we don’t nurture them. Before long, we look up and realize that no one
      really knows us. We’re surrounded by people but disconnected from meaningful brotherhood.
    </p>

    <p>That isolation is dangerous. When men are isolated:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our standards start to drift.</li>
      <li>Our discipline fades.</li>
      <li>Our sense of purpose dulls.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We stop sharpening each other, and our leadership weakens — in our homes, our jobs, and our communities.
      F3 was built to fight that. The <em>Workout</em> gets us moving, builds discipline, and teaches us to do hard things.
      The <em>COT</em> draws us together. The <em>Shield Lock</em> keeps us accountable. But even with those, many of
      us need something to guide how we grow and what kind of leaders we are becoming.
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s where QSource comes in. QSource exists because we need a framework — a map that keeps us accelerating
      in the right direction, together.
    </p>

    <hr class="sep">

    <h2>The Solution: What QSource Is</h2>

    <p>
      QSource is F3’s leadership manual — a guide to becoming a <strong>High Impact Man (HIM)</strong>.
      It’s built around the idea that leadership is a skill that can be learned, practiced, and refined —
      not something you’re born with.
    </p>

    <p>The framework is called <strong>G3L</strong>, standing for:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Get Right</strong> – the pursuit of personal alignment</li>
      <li><strong>Live Right</strong> – the dedication to purpose</li>
      <li><strong>Lead Right</strong> – the effective leadership of others</li>
      <li><strong>Leave Right</strong> – building a lasting legacy</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Each quadrant builds on the last. You can’t <em>Lead Right</em> if you haven’t <em>Gotten Right</em>.
      You can’t <em>Leave Right</em> unless you’ve <em>Lived Right</em>. And, although these quadrants build on
      each other, you never graduate from any of them. You’ll always keep coming back to each one — learning
      something new, seeing it from a different perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      QSource provides 50 short principles, called QPoints, that guide us through these four quadrants — from
      personal integrity all the way to legacy. Think of it as a playbook for living intentionally. It helps
      men see where they are, where they need to grow, and how to take the next step.
    </p>

    <p>
      There’s nothing magical about QSource. It is merely one of many leadership frameworks that exist in the universe.
      The magic happens when men live intentionally and in community.
    </p>

    <hr class="sep">

    <h2>The Practice: How It Works</h2>

    <p>
      In F3, growth happens in the context of shared experience. We don’t read QSource alone and call it a day —
      we discuss it, challenge each other, and apply it. That’s why QSource is built around conversation.
      Whether it’s a Shield Lock, a Whetstone, or a small group after the workout, the power of QSource comes from
      men sharpening men.
    </p>

    <p>Here’s how it fits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fitness builds the body.</li>
      <li>Fellowship strengthens relationships.</li>
      <li>Faith aligns the soul.</li>
      <li>QSource develops the leader.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As we go through Reindeer Games, each week will connect what we’re doing physically and relationally to these
      leadership principles. It’s all one mission — accelerating as men so that we can invigorate male community
      leadership wherever we are planted.
    </p>

    <hr class="sep">

    <h2>Wrap-Up and Challenge</h2>

    <p>
      The problem QSource solves is drift. Left alone, men drift — away from discipline, away from brotherhood,
      away from purpose. QSource provides a compass — not to make us perfect, but to keep us accelerating in the
      right direction.
    </p>

    <div class="challenge">
      <strong>This week, your challenge is simple:</strong>
      <p><em>Notice where isolation creeps in.</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where do you tend to go it alone?</li>
        <li>Who helps you stay on mission?</li>
        <li>What part of your life could use more alignment?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>F3 fights isolation through shared purpose. QSource sharpens that purpose through intentional growth.
      Together, they remind us: <strong>we were never meant to accelerate alone.</strong></p>
