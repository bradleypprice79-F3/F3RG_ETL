<h1>Week 6 – What’s Next?</h1>
<h2>The Obstacles to Acceleration</h2>

<div class="section">
    <p>Over the past 5 weeks, we’ve covered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>QSource Overview</strong> – What QSource is and why it’s useful</li>
        <li><strong>Get Right</strong> – Put your own mask on first so you can help others</li>
        <li><strong>Live Right</strong> – Be in proper relationship with others; help them with their mask</li>
        <li><strong>Lead Right</strong> – Develop the skills and virtues to influence movement to advantage</li>
        <li><strong>Leave Right</strong> – Construct a legacy that outlasts you</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So for Week 6, we’re asking: <strong>What’s Next?</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Where Do We Go From Here?</h2>
    <p><strong>Acceleration, of course!</strong></p>

    <p>But… what does acceleration actually look like?</p>

    <h3>RDG is a little crazy.</h3>
    <p>Because no one should be going to this many workouts every week! EC every day, multiple workouts daily—some of us have been absolute maniacs.</p>

    <p>And that’s fine. Like fasting, doing something extreme for a season can be great, but it’s not meant to be your daily lifestyle.</p>

    <p>If you pushed yourself during RDG, great. If you didn’t, that’s fine too. Either way: <strong>What’s next?</strong></p>

    <p>Maybe you learned you’re capable of more than you thought. Maybe you want to be more intentional with sleep. Maybe you want to journal. Maybe you’re building your 2026 8-Block.</p>

    <p><strong>Take a moment—seriously—to think about how you will continue to accelerate.</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Obstacles to Acceleration</h2>
    <p>We’ve all seen it: a guy is flying, accelerating in fitness, fellowship, faith, leadership… and then months later, he’s drifting. What happened?</p>

    <p>Don’t just look at his stall-out. Ask yourself: <strong>What could derail my acceleration?</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>1. Drift</h3>
    <p>A man without purpose inevitably drifts. Drift is the natural state of a man with no direction.</p>

    <p><strong>Causes of Drift:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Not taking the Daily Red Pill—failing to show up</li>
        <li>Losing continuity (no disciplines or routines)</li>
        <li>Lack of accountability</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>“Man left to his own devices will drift. Purpose and accountability arrest the Drift.”</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>2. Isolation</h3>
    <p>“Man is made to be in community.” Isolation is one of the fastest ways to stall out.</p>

    <p>Isolation kills acceleration because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You cannot Live Right or Lead Right alone</li>
        <li>Without a Shield Lock, you are fragile under stress</li>
        <li>Blind spots grow</li>
        <li>Fear and shame thrive in the dark</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As ScubaSteve said in Week 1: <strong>“Life has a way of isolating us.”</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>3. Comfort</h3>
    <p>Comfort is not bad, but choosing it over commitment will stall a man.</p>

    <p>The Fartsack represents:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Laziness</li>
        <li>Excuses</li>
        <li>The gravitational pull toward ease</li>
        <li>Avoiding discomfort and challenge</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>“The Comfort Zone is a cage disguised as a recliner.”</blockquote>

    <p>Know your commitments. Make them public. Choose commitment over comfort.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>4. Fear</h3>
    <p>Fear is a universal inhibitor—fear of failure, rejection, responsibility.</p>

    <p>Fear + comfort = the perfect recipe for stalling out.</p>

    <blockquote>“Courage is not the absence of fear, but doing the thing while afraid.”</blockquote>

    <p>The unknown is always scarier than the actual moment. Move anyway.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>5. Shame & Isolation Loops</h3>
    <p>The shame loop:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A man struggles</li>
        <li>He hides it</li>
        <li>He isolates</li>
        <li>The problem grows</li>
        <li>He’s less likely to reach out</li>
        <li>He quits accelerating</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Shield Locks and Whetstone relationships break this cycle.</p>
    <p>Failure is normal—don’t let shame isolate you.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>6. The Crack Pipe of the Status Quo</h3>
    <p>Leadership requires disrupting what is. The Status Quo resists change.</p>

    <p>A man stalls when he avoids conflict or disruption.</p>

    <blockquote>“The HIM disrupts what IS to accelerate what COULD BE.”</blockquote>

    <p>Routine is good—until it becomes a cage. Don’t get stuck in WHAT IS. Think about WHAT’S NEXT.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>What’s Next!?</h2>
    <p>You thought about it, right?</p>

    <p>Write it down. Share it with someone who will hold you accountable.  
    And stay alert to the obstacles.</p>

    <p><strong>Keep accelerating—one intentional choice at a time.</strong></p>
